* Development (v4.1)
** Ledger-mode now requires Emacs 25 or later
** ledger-add-transaction now uses org-read-date
This is more consistent with the behavior of =ledger-copy-transaction-at-point=
and =ledger-insert-effective-date=. In order to disable the pop-up calendar, bind
=org-read-date-popup-calendar= to nil. The command now prompts twice - once for
the date and another time for the xact text. If you find this annoying, set
=ledger-add-transaction-prompt-for-text= to nil.
* Release v4.0.0
** The completion system now respects whatever completion system the user prefers
Some users prefer different completion systems such as ivy or helm. To get the
old behavior back, see the instructions in the ledger manual under the heading
"Adding Transactions."

Additionally, we now realign transactions after completion, see
ledger-post-auto-align.
** New option ledger-post-auto-align controls whether post amounts automatically align
** New options control whether the report name/command get printed in the report buffer
New option ledger-report-use-header-line controls this behavior and
ledger-report-header-line-fn controls how the information is reported.
** New option ledger-default-date-format is now used consistently
Ledger-mode uses this option to insert dates whenever it is needed.
** Report buffers are now highlighted by ledger
So, for example, debts are usually red and deposits blue.

New option ledger-report-use-native-highlighting controls this behavior.

** Ledger now matches the width of report buffers
Option ledger-report-auto-width controls whether we pass this information to
ledger or not.
** Ledger-mode gained support for flymake
This supports checking for errors in syntax.

Two new options ledger-flymake-be-pedantic and ledger-flymake-be-explicit
control which flags get passed to ledger during checking.
** Report windows can be automatically resized
See new option ledger-report-resize-window
** All faces used by ledger now inherit from other faces.
This should make ledger-mode look better when used with various themes that
don't provide support for ledger-mode explicitly.
** New option ledger-report-use-strict controls whether --strict gets passed to reports
** The fontification system (syntax highlighting) was completely rewritten
** In report buffers, M-n and M-p move to the next and previous month
See the "Expansion Formats" section of the ledger mode manual to see examples on
how to use this.
** New hook ledger-report-after-report-hook runs after the report has been created
** In report buffers, $ toggles converting to the default commodity 
** Two new commands move between uncleared transactions
New commands ledger-navigate-next-uncleared and
ledger-navigate-previous-uncleared move to the next and previous uncleared
transactions. These don't have default keybindings.
** New option ledger-accounts-exclude-function
This allows users to exclude some accounts from being offered during completion.
This is useful if, for example, you have a lot of accounts but only use some of
them rarely.
